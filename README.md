Honors Python 2023 Final Project:
When you run this code, a seperate page will open containing the weather app.
Type in a desired location in the box, then hit the check weather button.
You will see the weather conditions for that location show up.
I chose to build a weather app that tells a user the temperature, feels like, pressure, humidity, wind, sunrise and sunset, cloud cover, and conditions. I wanted to do this project because it relates to my goal of working for the weather channelâ€™s web team in the future. I ran into problems with the temperature, because it was displaying weird values for the location that you typed in. I had to adjust some of the values in the code so that it would display more accurate temperatures. If I had more time on this project, I would want to include graphics in the app, such as icons to represent sunny weather, clouds, rain, etc. I would also want to make it a little more decorative rather than just a few boxes and text.
